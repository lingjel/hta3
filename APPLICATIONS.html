	<b> # APPLICATION OF GREEN'S THEOREM:</b>
      <p>One (complex-world) application of Green's theorem is in the proof of Cauchy's theorem, which states that for complex-valued function f that is analytic inside and on a simple closed curve γ, ∫γf(z)dz=0. This is an extremely useful result from complex analysis. This shows us that Green's theorem is perhaps farther reaching than you might think, because we're using a result originally stated in terms of vector fields and scalar fields to show something about the complex numbers.</p>


<p>Green's theorem is actually a special case of a more general phenomenon, relating an integral over some surface to an integral over its boundary. The general theorem I'm alluding to is called Stokes' theorem, and it is extremely useful: sometimes we come across an integral over some surface that is very hard to evaluate, but using Stokes' theorem, we can change that integral into another one (which sometimes becomes much easier to evaluate!). This is actually a generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: if F is an antiderivative of f on [a,b], then ∫baf=F(b)−F(a). The left hand side is the integral over the surface (in this case, just an interval), and the right hand side is the integral on its boundary (with the proper interpretations, of course).</p>

<p>The simplest to build a real-world application of a mathematical theorem such as Green's Theorem is the planimeter. It's actually useful and extremely cool.A planimeter, also known as a platometer, is a measuring instrument used to determine the area of an arbitrary two-dimensional shape.</p>


<b> # APPLICATION OF STOKE'S THEOREM :</b>

<p>The need for Stokes theorem arises when dealing with the vector calculus.</p>
<p>Actually,</p>
<p>Water turbines and cyclone may be a example of Stokes and Green’s theorem.Stokes's theorem is a widely applicable theorem in mathematics as well as in many other fields. This theorem is proved to be very important tool in combination with Gauss' theorem in order to work with different sorts of line integrals and surface integrals.</p>

<p>Other field of application include:</p>

<p>Stokes' theorem is also used for the interpretation of curl of a vector field. This theorem is quite often used in physics, especially in electromagnetism. Stokes' theorem and its generalized form are very important in finding line integral of some particular curve and also in determining the curl of a bounded surface.</p>
